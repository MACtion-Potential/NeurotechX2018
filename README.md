# NeurotechX2018
This repository contains all code that will be submitted to the Neurotech 2018 student competition.
The idea behind this project is to explore the ability to read brain signals and interpret them in a meaningful way.
To show this, we are using a Muse headband to read signals and a MeArm robotic arm as a system to control. The aim of this project 
will be to read a signal to halt the automated motion of a robotic arm.

## Muse headband
Using muse headband with the help of the muse-lsl library: https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl

## MeArm
This project works with a MeArm controlled with an Arduino using the MeArm library: https://github.com/SamuelSVD/MeArm
